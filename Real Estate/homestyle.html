				<figcaption>
					<h4>Modern cozy classic house in colonial style</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Arguably one of the most popular styles of home in the country, the colonial appeals to many for its spaciousness and elegance. Many modern colonials consist of a partially finished basement, first-floor formal living room, dining room, eat-in kitchen, family room and half-bath. The bedrooms and bathrooms are on the second floor.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Symmetrical square shape</li>
				<li>Front door in the center with two windows on either side</li>
				<li>Five windows across the front of the second floor (with one directly above the front door)</li>
				<li>Medium-pitched roof</li>
				<li>Paired chimneys</li>
				<li>Stairway behind the front door</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Cape Cod</h2>

				<figcaption>
					<h4>The steeply pitched roof and dormers are signature trademarks of a Cape Cod.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Designed to withstand the elements, this simple-style home dates back to the original Colonists. Cape Cods are common in the Northern part of the country, and are efficient to heat with their low ceilings. Twentieth century Cape Cods usually have a pair of dormers, and the shutters are purely decorative.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Rectangular shape</li>
				<li>Steeply pitched roof</li>
				<li>Narrow roof overhang</li>
				<li>1 to 1 ½ stories</li>
				<li>Constructed of wood and sided in wide clapboard or shingles</li>
				<li>Multiple fireplaces</li>
				<li>Front door placed at the center</li>
				<li>Double-hung windows on either side of door</li>
				<li>Shutters</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Contemporary</h2>
			
			<!--featured image-->
			<figure>
				<img class="icon-location" src="img/three.svg" alt="home style">
				<img src="img/contemporary.jpg" alt="contemporary style architecture">
				<figcaption>
					<h4>Contemporary style features open floor plans with lots of natural lights and geometric lines.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Given that a contemporary-style home literally doesn’t fit into any box, the exact design elements will vary from house to house. And yet, you know one when you see one. Pay particular attention to the windows, as their size or irregular shape may result in air loss if they weren’t properly installed. The roof might also prove problematic. Flat roofs, highly angular roofs or roofs made of unique materials should be thoroughly inspected regularly to ensure they’re sealed properly to prevent water damage.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Asymmetrical facade and floor plan</li>
				<li>Extensive use of natural light</li>
				<li>Geometric shapes</li>
				<li>Open floor plan</li>
				<li>Seamless transition between indoor and outdoor space</li>
				<li>Clean lines throughout</li>
				<li>Large windows</li>
				<li>1 or 2 stories</li>
				<li>Use of sustainable materials</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Craftsman</h2>

					<h4>Nice curb appeal of American craftsman style house.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">A Craftsman home is distinctly American, originating in Southern California at the turn of the 20th century. Homeowners are attracted to the home’s symmetry, ornate wood trim and a simple, open layout that typically makes the most of limited square footage.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Low-pitched gable roof</li>
				<li>Deeply overhanging eaves</li>
				<li>Front porch (supported by tapered columns)</li>
				<li>Exposed rafters or decorative brackets</li>
				<li>Use of mixed materials in structure</li>
				<li>4-over-1 or 6-over-1 double-hung windows</li>
				<li>Single dormers</li>
				<li>Front door with partial glass panes</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Mediterranean</h2>

				<figcaption>
					<h4>Mediterranean style waterfront home with stucco walls and columned porch.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Popular in Florida, California and throughout the Southwest, Mediterranean-style homes are based on the architecture found during the early Spanish colonization of North and South America. While most homes are finished with white, cream or beige stucco exterior walls, it’s not unheard of for some Mediterranean homes to be painted in pastel colors such as pink, orange, peach or yellow.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Low-pitched roof comprised of red tiles</li>
				<li>Stucco walls</li>
				<li>Arches</li>
				<li>Courtyards or patios</li>
				<li>Wrought-iron railings</li>
				<li>Front porch defined by stone columns and arches</li>
				<li>Use of limestone</li>
				<li>Painted tile</li>
				<li>Balconies</li>
				<li>Exposed wooden beams</li>
				<li>Wooden doors</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Ranch</h2>

					<h4>1980's Brick Ranch Style House in the Suburbs.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Ranch (or rambler) homes gained popularity with the post-war generation of the mid-20th century. But as land became more expensive, developers turned their focus toward two-story homes, which required less land and were less expensive to build than a ranch.Most ranches have at least a partial basement, which is attractive as an extra living space.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Single story</li>
				<li>Low and long roofline</li>
				<li>Large overhanging eaves</li>
				<li>Living area separate from bedrooms</li>
				<li>Large picture window</li>
				<li>Post and beam ceilings</li>
				<li>Sliding glass doors to a patio</li>
				<li>Attached garage</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Tudor</h2>
			
			<!--featured image-->
			<figure>
				<img class="icon-location" src="img/seven.svg" alt="home style">
				<img src="img/tudor.jpg" alt="Tudor style architecture">
				<figcaption>
					<h4>Large tudor style house with bay window.</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Constructed with brick, stone, concrete and slate, American Tudor-style homes pay an appropriate homage to homes built in 16th century England during the Tudor Dynasty. One of the most recognizable styles, a Tudor tends to hold up well over time due to the strength of the construction materials. Tudors are often painted in brown, cream and white tones to complement the materials used. Found primarily in Northern climates, these homes often feature grand fireplaces, exposed timbers and stained-glass windows.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Steeply pitched rooflines</li>
				<li>Small dormers</li>
				<li>Decorative half-timbering</li>
				<li>Prominent cross gables</li>
				<li>Arched front doorway surrounded by decorative brick or stone</li>
				<li>Leaded glass windows</li>
				<li>Dark wood paneling on the interior</li>
				<li>Large stone chimney</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-80">Victorian</h2>
			
			<!--featured image-->

				<img src="img/victorian.jpg" alt="Victorian style architecture">
				<figcaption>
					<h4>Victorian style home!</h4>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="mt-80">Victorians are like snowflakes — no two are exactly alike. This ornate-style of home emerged during the reign of Queen Victoria, during a period in which architecture was valued for its beauty rather than its practicality. Built as showpieces, Victorians are more costly to heat and cool due to their sheer size. Any remodeling, including updates to HVAC and the plumbing, will most likely cost a pretty penny and will take the skill set of an experienced contractor to navigate the century-old construction.</p>

			<h4>Traditional features:</h4>

			<ul class="mb-80">
				<li>Two-to-three stories</li>
				<li>Wood exterior</li>
				<li>Complicated asymmetrical shape</li>
				<li>Ornamental trim</li>
				<li>Textured wall surfaces</li>
				<li>Steep multi-faceted roof</li>
				<li>Vibrant colors</li>
				<li>Large porch with decorative spindles</li>
				<li>Tall brick chimneys</li>
				<li>Bay windows</li>
				<li>Stained glass</li>
				<li>Fireplace in every room</li>
